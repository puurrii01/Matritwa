 ### About Project:
The idea is to help pregnant women by offering the services and resources they need to ensure a safe pregnancy. While it is specifically designed for expectant mothers, it is also a valuable resource for their family members and caregivers. Our goal is to create a comprehensive support system that promotes the well-being of both the mother and her baby throughout the pregnancy journey, and to educate people about maternal health.
